# 🌍 World Population Visualization Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an **interactive dashboard** for visualizing **world population statistics** across countries and regions using clear, engaging, and informative data visualizations.  
The dashboard leverages **data visualization principles** and **best practices** — inspired by research such as *Mapping the Landscape of COVID-19 Crisis Visualizations* — to ensure that complex population data is communicated effectively to both expert and general audiences.

The aim is to:
- Provide **clear insights** into population distribution, growth trends, and demographic patterns.
- Enable **comparisons** across countries and continents.
- Demonstrate **data visualization best practices** including color choice, labeling, and context-aware design.
